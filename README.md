### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Configure API Key

This project requires a Perplexity API Key ([Get one here](https://www.perplexity.ai/)).

1. Create a `.env` file in the project root directory with the following content:

    ```
    PPLX_API_KEY=your_perplexity_api_key
    ```

2. The `.env` file is already in `.gitignore` and will not be uploaded.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Start the Service

```bash
cd flask_pdf_chat
python app.py --port=5004
```

- Default port is 5003. You can specify another port with `--port=xxxx`.
